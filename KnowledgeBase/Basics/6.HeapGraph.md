# 1. Heap

## 1.1 Basics

A max heap is a Binary Tree that **always** satisfies the following conditions

1. Being a **Complete Binary Tree**

2. Any node is **smaller or equal** to the nodes underneath

is represented as an unsorted array 

| index   | 0    | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    | 6    |
| ------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| element | 1    | 3    | 2    | 5    | 4    | 7    |      |

The relationship between indices and tree nodes
$$
\begin{align*}
\textsf{left child index}&=\textsf{current index}*2+1\\
\textsf{right child index}&=\textsf{current index}*2+2\\
\textsf{parent index}&=\frac{\textsf{current index}-1}{2}
\end{align*}
$$
The indexing relationship is **perfect for swaping** nodes up & down, a process known as **percolating**. The heap **could percolate after every offer / poll** to make sure it always satisfy the 2 basic conditions mentioned above.

A heap w/ root  being the smallest is a **MIN heap**. One w/ root being the largest is a **MAX heap**.



##  1.2 Offer

For a MAX heap [9, 8, 7, 4, 1, 6, 0, 2], **offer** 18, 10, 11

![offering](/Users/apple/Desktop/KnowledgeBase/Basics/images/offering.gif)

- Always **insert** on last level empity slot that is **as left as possible** so the tree stays **complete**.
- A node could travel/percolate **up as many as logn (height) times**. So time complexity is O(logn).
- The heap is implemented as an array, and percolating is implemented by swaping.



## 1.3 Poll

For a MAX heap [18, 11, 7, 8, 10, 6, 0, 2, 4, 1, 9], **poll** 4 times

![polling](/Users/apple/Desktop/KnowledgeBase/Basics/images/polling.gif)

- Always replace root with **right most leaf node** so the tree stays **complete**, than **percolate the new root node down** so the second requirement is met.

- When percolating down for MAX heap, always **pick the larger child node between the two** to swap, so the second requirement is garenteed.

- A new root node could travel/percolate down **as many as logn (height) times**. So time complexity is O(logn).

  

## 1.4 Other Operations

1. **update**: Change value of one node. Will need to percolate up or down as many as logn (height) times to make sure second requirement. So Time = O(logn).
2. **get/top/peek**: Get the value of root node **without** polling. Takes time O(1).
3. **Heapify**: Convert an unsorted array into a heap. Takes time O(n). Checkout heap sort wikipedia for more info, will **NOT** be required for this class.



## 1.5 Example: k smallest values

Find **smallest** k elements from an unsorted array of size n

**Solution**: 

0. Sort with O(nlogn), then get first k entries, which is the worst solution.
1. Heapify array into MIN heap which takes O(n), than poll k times to get result which takes O(k*logn). This has a total time of **O(n+klogn)**
2. **Use MAX heap**
   1. Put first k elements into max heap w/ heapify (Time = O(k))
   2. Compare new element X with root of max heap
      1. Case #1: if **X < max-heap.top()**, then **max-heap.poll()** and **max-heap.offer(X)**
      2. Case #2: else, do nothing
   3. Since every element after the first k (a total of n-k), could require one offer and one poll, the worst case run time for step 2 is **O((n-k)logk)**

**Note**: The better solution between 1 and 2 is dependent on situation. 

|       Case       | n + klogn | (n - k) * logk |
| :--------------: | :-------: | :------------: |
| k << n (say k=3) |  O(c*n)   |     n*logk     |
|  k  = (1/2) * n  | O(nlogn)  |    O(nlogn)    |

In both case, it is very hard to say which one is better, so there is **NO** correct answer.

3. Solution #3: The modified quick sort (quick select) that we've went over. It has average time of O(n) and a worst time of O(n^2).



# 2. Dijkstra's Algorithm

**Replacing queue in Breadth First Search with Priority Queue / Heap**, turning it into **Best First Search**

<img src="/Users/apple/Desktop/KnowledgeBase/Basics/images/6-2.png" alt="6-2" style="zoom:50%;" />

**Goal**: Start from **Node 4** and find cheapest path to **Node 1**. 

We need a Priority Queue called **H**. It is a MIN heap that Compare nodes by cost. We also need a HashSet (or some other means) to store visited nodes called **V**. The step of Dijkstra's algorithm goes as follows:

1. Add Node 4 into H, mark it as Visited

$$
\begin{align*}
\H=&[\hspace{0.25cm}(4,\hspace{0.1cm}cost=0)\hspace{0.25cm}]\\
V=&[\hspace{0.25cm}4\hspace{0.25cm}]\\
\end{align*}
$$

2. Poll from **H**, get node (4, cost = 0) and **expand** from this node, **generate** 6, 3, 5 and offer to **H** while also marking them as visited.

$$
\begin{align*}
\H=[\hspace{0.25cm}
&(6,\hspace{0.1cm}cost=1)\\
&(3,\hspace{0.1cm}cost=1)\\
&(5,\hspace{0.1cm}cost=10)
\hspace{0.25cm}]\\
V=[\hspace{0.25cm}&4,\hspace{0.1cm}6,\hspace{0.1cm}3,\hspace{0.1cm}5\hspace{0.25cm}]\\
\end{align*}
$$

3. Poll from **H**, get node (6, cost = 1) and **expand** from this node, since 4 is in Visited, **generate nothing**
   $$
   \begin{align*}
   \H=[\hspace{0.25cm}
   &(3,\hspace{0.1cm}cost=1)\\
   &(5,\hspace{0.1cm}cost=10)
   \hspace{0.25cm}]\\
   V=[\hspace{0.25cm}&4,\hspace{0.1cm}6,\hspace{0.1cm}3,\hspace{0.1cm}5\hspace{0.25cm}]\\
   \end{align*}
   $$

4. Poll from **H**, get node (3, cost = 1) and **expand** from this node, **generate** 2 and offer to **H** while also marking it as visited. **Note its cost is 1 + 1 = 2 **.

$$
\begin{align*}
\H=[\hspace{0.25cm}
&(2,\hspace{0.1cm}cost=2)\\
&(5,\hspace{0.1cm}cost=10)
\hspace{0.25cm}]\\
V=[
\hspace{0.25cm}&4,
\hspace{0.1cm}6,
\hspace{0.1cm}3,
\hspace{0.1cm}5,
\hspace{0.1cm}2
\hspace{0.25cm}]\\
\end{align*}
$$

5. Poll from **H**, get node (2, cost = 2) and **expand** from this node, **generate** 1, 5 and offer to **H** while also marking them as visited. **Note** we're **updating** 5's cost from 10 to 3

$$
\begin{align*}
\H=[\hspace{0.25cm}
&(1,\hspace{0.1cm}cost=3)\\
&(5,\hspace{0.1cm}cost=3)
\hspace{0.25cm}]\\
V=[
\hspace{0.25cm}&4,
\hspace{0.1cm}6,
\hspace{0.1cm}3,
\hspace{0.1cm}5,
\hspace{0.1cm}2,
\hspace{0.1cm}1
\hspace{0.25cm}]\\
\end{align*}
$$

6. Poll 5 and then 3, generating nothing both steps. Algorithm terminates when heap is empity.

## 2.1 Properties of Dij.

1. A node can be **expanded** once and only once
2. A node can be **generated** more then once (cost can be later reduced)
3. Expanded / polled nodes have **monotonically non-decreasing** cost. Note traversal/poll order goes **4, 6, 3, 2, 5, 1**, which is essentially the ascending rank of distance from node 4. This is the most important property of Dij.'s algorithm.
4. **Time complexity** for graph with **n** node, each with let's say 4 connections, is **O(nlogn)**. For general graph is O(E log V), E for # of edges, V for # of vertices.
5. When a node is expanded / polled, its cost value is fixed, equal to the shortest distance to source. 



# Example: k'th smallest value

Given a matrix with sorted row and columns, find the k'th smallest value. For example
$$
\space\begin{bmatrix}
1&2&3&5&6\\
2&3&4&6&8\\
3&4&5&7&9\\
4&5&6&8&10\\
5&6&9&10&11
\end{bmatrix}\space\\
\\
\text{k=7}\rightarrow\text{return}\space4\\
\text{k=10}\rightarrow\text{return}\space5\\
$$
**Solution**: See matrix as a graph with differences between values as costs.
