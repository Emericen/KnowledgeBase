# 1. Recursion

You already know about recursion, base case and recursion rule. So let's dive right in.

## 1.1 Fibonacci Sequence

Base case: F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1

Recursion rule: F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)

```java
int fibo(int n) {
	if (n == 0) {
    // Base case
		return 0;
	} else if (n == 1) {
    // Base case
		return 1;
	} else {
    // recursion rule
		return fibo(n - 1) + fibo(n - 2);
	}
}
```



### a). Time Complexity

We did runtime analysis in Foundations series. But we won't be using the old way, instead we do the following. Let's say n = 4, then the recursion tree looks like

<img src="/Users/apple/Desktop/KnowledgeBase/Basics/images/lecture 3-1.png" alt="lecture 3-1" style="zoom:50%;" />

From observation, we see that given input n, we know there are n levels in the recursion tree. Therefore
$$
Time = 1+2^1+2^2+2^3+ .... +2^{n-1}=O(2^n)
$$
Remember this is called a **Geometric Series**, although its official formula is
$$
a+ar+ar^2+ar^3+...+ar^n=\sum_{i=0}^{n}ar^i=a(\frac{1-r^{n-1}}{1-r})
$$
For our case where r=2, a=1, note that each term is sum of all its previous term plus 1
$$
\begin{align*}
2^1&=2^0+1\\
2^2&=2^1+2^0+1\\
2^3&=2^2+2^1+2^0+1\\
&...\\
2^n&=2^{n-1}+2^{n-2}+...+2^2+2^1+2^0+1
\end{align*}
$$
Which means
$$
\sum_{i=0}^{n}2^i=2*2^n-1
$$
Thus the runtime for Fibo is
$$
Time=2*2^{n-1}-1=2^n-1=O(2^n)
$$

### b). Space Complexity

Space complexity is essentially **the maximum height of call stack for this function during its life time**, aka the largest amount of memory the algorithm needs, considering it releases at the same time it takes up.

Look at the recursion tree, notice how the excution is **Depth First**. Thus the space complexity is essentially the longest distance from root node to leaf node.



> John von Neumann invented call stack, the core for von Neumann structure of modern day computer.



Therefore space complexity for fibo() is O(n)

### c). Notes

- Recursion time complexity is **NOT** # of nodes in recursion tree
- Recursion time complexity is **NOT** # of nodes on last layer of recursion tree
- Recursion time complexity is **NOT** sum of time complexity on the last layer of recursion tree
- Recursion space complexity is **NOT** # of recursion tree layers
- Recursion space complexity is **NOT** sum of space complexity on each node.



## 1.2 Power

the original way of a*f(a, b-1) has time complexity of O(n). However, the following way has time complexity of O(log n).

Practice setting base case and recursion case.

```java
int pow(int a, int b) {
	if (b == 1) {
		return a;
	}
	int temp = pow(a, b / 2);
	if (b % 2 == 0) {
		return temp * temp;
	} else {
		return temp * temp * a;
	}
}
```

The key here to remember is that 
$$
O(n^2)>O(n\log{n})>O(n)>O(\log{n})
$$
So we'd always like to **splite a problem into small problems**





# 2. Sorting Algorithm

All you need to completely understand to solve all related problems are 3 types of sorting algorithms:

1. **Selection Sort**
2. **Merge Sort**
3. **Quick Sort**
4. ...

## 2.1 Selection Sort

Always find global minimum one by one
$$
\begin{align*}
[-1,-3,7,4]&\rightarrow[-3,-1,4,7]\\
iteration\ 1: [-1,-3,7,4]&\rightarrow-3, [-1,7,4]\\
iteration\ 2: -3, [-1,4,7]&\rightarrow-3, -1, [7,4]\\
iteration\ 3: -3, -1, [7,4]&\rightarrow-3,-1,4,[7]\ \leftarrow complete\ !\\

\end{align*}
$$
As you can see, it is 4 iteration for 4 elements, meaning Selection Sort has a **time complexity of O(n)**

### a). Writing the code

Before you start, know that a complete answer for big tech interviews should go along the following steps

1. **Document your assumptions**: What do you want? Ascending? Descending? **Examples**?
2. **Explain your approach & how you intend to solve the problem**: Selection Sort? Recursion?
3. **Provide code comments where applicable:** MUST have comments for function with 3 or more params.
4. Explain big-O **run time complexity** of your program. Jusitify your answer
5. Identify additional **data structures** you used and why you use them
6. Only provide your best answer to **each part of the question**



### b). My Solution

```java
// selection sort for int array a
void selectionSort(int[] a) {
	// Outter loop: number of iterations
	for (int i = 0; i < a.length - 1; i++) {
		// Inner loop: find minimum value in the unsorted portion
		// and make it the first element by swapping
		for (int j = i + 1; j < a.length; j++) {
			if (a[j] < a[i]) {
				int temp = a[i];
				a[i] = a[j];
				a[j] = temp;
			}
		}
	}
}
// Space complexity: O(1) for not being recursive
// Time complexity: O(n)
```

Now explained how it works like Todd Kerpelman, and we're done.



### c). 举一反三

Given an array stored in Stack, how to sort the numbers by using additions 2 stacks?
$$
\begin{align*}
Stack\ a&:\ \big[9,8,0,2,1,6\\
Stack\ buffer&:\ \big[\\
Stack\ result&:\ \big[
\end{align*}
$$
My answer: 

```
#1. push a.pop into result
#2. while a isn't empty
			if a.pop>result.pop
      	push a.pop into buffer
      else
      	push result.pop into buffer
      	push a.pop into result
#3. pop all of buffer and push back to a, or swap roles between a & buffer
```



## 2.2 Merge Sort

### a). Basics

![lecture 3-2](/Users/apple/Desktop/KnowledgeBase/Basics/images/lecture 3-2.png)

Split array into two and recursively sort each half, where base case is not spliting array with one element. After obtaining the result, use left and right pointer to compare and put in the smaller element to make a larger, sorted result array.  

Note the function initiate arrays on call so there's heap usage on every layer of recursion tree, where it's n on the leaf layer. Remember that stack space are function calls, heap space are objects initiated.
$$
\begin{align*}
Time\ Complexity&=spliting+joining\\
&=O(1+2+4+..+n)+O(n\log{n})\\
&=O(n)+O(n\log{n})\\
&=O(n\log{n})\\
Space\ Complexity&=stack+heap\\
&=O(\log{n})+O(n+\frac{n}{2}+\frac{n}{4}+..+\frac{n}{n})\\
&=O(\log{n})+O(n)\\
&=O(\log{n})
\end{align*}
$$

```java
int[] mergeSort(int[] a) {
	if (a.length == 1) {
		// Base case
		return a;
	} else {
		// Recursion case
		// #1. split a by half;
		int[] left = new int[a.length / 2];
		int[] right = new int[a.length - (a.length / 2)];
		for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
			if (i < a.length / 2) {
				left[i] = a[i];
			} else {
				right[i - a.length / 2] = a[i];
			}
		}

		// #2. mergeSort both half;
		int[] sortLeft = mergeSort(left);
		int[] sortRight = mergeSort(right);

		// #3. compare and combine result to create new a;
		int l = 0;
		int r = 0;
		int index = 0;
		while (l != sortLeft.length || r != sortRight.length) {
			if (l == sortLeft.length) {
				// if left is already at the end, push right
				a[index] = sortRight[r];
				r++;
			} else if (r == sortRight.length) {
				// if right is already at the end, push left
				a[index] = sortLeft[l];
				l++;
			} else if (sortLeft[l] > sortRight[r]) {
				// if left index element is greater than that on the right, push right
				a[index] = sortRight[r];
				r++;
			} else if (sortLeft[l] < sortRight[r]) {
				// if right index element is greater than that on the left, push left
				a[index] = sortLeft[l];
				l++;
			}
			index++;
		}
		return a;
	}
}
```

### b). 举一反三 (medium difficulty)

1. Can we use a merge sort on linked list? What are the time/space complexity?

   **Answer**: of course. Note the time complexity would be O(nlogn), because linked list takes time O(n) to do indexing, so spliting by half would take O(n) on every layer.

2. Given a string "A1B2C3D4", how to convert it to another string "ABCD1234"?

   **Answer**: You just need to override a comparator. They might ask you to do it **in place**, meaning return the original string, not a new one, which makes this a hard difficulty.



## 2.3 Quick Sort

### a). Basics

1. Given an array, pick one element
2. every element smaller then the one picked in step 1, go to its right; every element larger go to its left
3. repeat from step one for both sub-arrays left and right
4. use base case of array with length one.



### b). Best Implementation

Split into 3 subsections. The actual meaning of each section

1. [0...i]  ---  everything left of i, not including i, are smaller than pivot.
2. [i....j]  ---  uncertain area.
3. [j....n-1]  ---  everything right of j, not including j, are larger than pivot.

Notice that swapping are about the only good option we have in Java: we need to quit using sub arrays. The operation we do are as follows. For example, given [1,9,8,5,3]

Put 5 to right-most position by **swap(5, n-1)**

| after step 1 |   1   |  9   |  8   |   3   |    5    |
| :----------: | :---: | :--: | :--: | :---: | :-----: |
|              | i --> |      |      | <-- j | (pivot) |

Current # 1 < pivot, so nothing changes. just **i++**

| after step 2 |  1   |   9   |  8   |   3   |    5    |
| :----------: | :--: | :---: | :--: | :---: | :-----: |
|              |      | i --> |      | <-- j | (pivot) |

Current # 9 > pivot, so put 9 to the right of j by **swap(i,j)**, then **j--**

| after step 3 |  1   |   3   |   8   |  9   |    5    |
| :----------: | :--: | :---: | :---: | :--: | :-----: |
|              |      | i --> | <-- j |      | (pivot) |

Current # 3 < pivot, so again nothing changes. **i++**

| after step 4 |  1   |  3   |      8       |  9   |    5    |
| :----------: | :--: | :--: | :----------: | :--: | :-----: |
|              |      |      | i -->  <-- j |      | (pivot) |

Current # 8 > pivot, so **swap(i,j)**. (which doesn't affect anything), then **j--**

| after step 5 |  1   |   3   |   8   |  9   |    5    |
| :----------: | :--: | :---: | :---: | :--: | :-----: |
|              |      | <-- j | i --> |      | (pivot) |

Stop condition trigger. Put pivot back by **swap(n-1,i)**. That does it for one recursion.

Notice the actual meaning of each sub-section is satisfied at all time during the steps.

The **worst case runtime for quick sort is O(n^2)**

### c). 举一反二

1. Given an array, put all zeros to the right end. 

   **Answer**: no zero left of i, all zeros right of j

2. Rainbow sort:

   abcbbabcbabcbabaacbbcbabcbbabc --> aaaaaaaaa bbbbbbbbb ccccccccc....

   **Answer**: 

   1. [0...i) ----> a
   2. [i...j) ----> b
   3. [j...k] ----> uncertain
   4. (k...n-1]  ----> c

   i=0, j=0, k=n-1

   Case #1: n[i] == a: swap(i,j), i++, j++

   Case #2: n[i] == b: j++

   Case #3: n[i] == c: swap(j,k), k--

   Time = O(n), Space = O(1)

3. What if rainbow sort has 4 colors?
