# ISE 460 Discussion Fri. 09/03/2021

There will be appendix given on formulars needed for the exam. 

> "99% of problems on exam is going to be calculation base. You can plug in the formular, but they'll get longer and longer as we move forward".

I notice that almost all of the calculation for this class is done on **Excel**. I gotta CSDN this bitch.

> "Cash flows diagram (the horizontal line with vertical arrows shooting out) is not going to be given"

**Excel function** always looks something like:
$$
F = P(F| i\%, n)
$$
I need to excel at Excel cashflow handling. Learn it and do practice problems from discussion session.

Specifically, I need to know

- Regular Series
  - PV function in excel
- Irregular Series
  - MPV function in excel
